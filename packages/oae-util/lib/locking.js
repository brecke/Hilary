     * For example, if you are on the smaller side of a network partition you will fail to acquire a lock,
     * but you don't know if the lock exists on the other side; all you know is that you can't
     * guarantee exclusivity on yours.
     *
     * That said, for many tasks it's sufficient to attempt a lock with retryCount=0, and treat a
     * failure as the resource being "locked" or (more correctly) "unavailable",
     * With retryCount=-1 there will be unlimited retries until the lock is aquired.
